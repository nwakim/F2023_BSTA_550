# Chapter 35: Normal Variables {#chapter-35-normal-variables .unnumbered}

-   I will not cover normal rv's in detail here since I expect you have
    already learned about normal random variables and $z$-scores in
    statistics classes you have taken.

-   Make sure you know how to use a normal distribution $z$-table if you
    will be taking the MS Biostatistics comprehensive exam, since that
    is what will be provided during the exam.
