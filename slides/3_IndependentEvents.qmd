## Slide 1

**Question:** Which of the following sequences of coin tosses of heads ($H$) and tails ($T$) is more likely to happen, assuming the coin is fair?

$$HTTHHHTHTHHTTTH$$ or $$HTTTTTTTTHTTTTT$$

## Slide 2

Definition: Independence
:::

::: def-cont
*Events* $A$ and $B$ are **independent** if $$\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = \mathbb{P}(A) \cdot  \mathbb{P}(B).$$
:::
:::

**Notation:** For shorthand, we sometimes write $$A \mathrel{\unicode{x2AEB}} B,$$ to denote that $A$ and $B$ are independent events.

*Two dice (red and blue) are rolled. Let* $A =$ event a total of 7 appears, and $B =$ event first die is a six. Are events $A$ and $B$ independent?

::: def-cont
*Events* $A$, $B$, and $C$ are **independent** if

1.  

    -   $\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = \mathbb{P}(A) \cdot \mathbb{P}(B)$

    -   $\mathbb{P}(A \cap C) = \mathbb{P}(A) \cdot \mathbb{P}(C)$

    -   $\mathbb{P}(B \cap C) = \mathbb{P}(B) \cdot \mathbb{P}(C)$

2.  $\mathbb{P}(A \cap B \cap C) = \mathbb{P}(A) \cdot \mathbb{P}(B) \cdot \mathbb{P}(C)$

**Remark:**

On your homework you will show that $(1) \not \Rightarrow (2)$ and $(2) \not \Rightarrow (1)$.

Example 4

::: ex-cont
*Suppose you take a random sample of* $n$ people, of which people are smokers and non-smokers independently of each other. Let

-   $A_i =$ event person $i$ is a smoker, for $i=1, \ldots ,n$, and

-   $p_i =$ probability person $i$ is a smoker, for $i=1, \ldots ,n$. Find the probability that at least one person in the random sample is a smoker.

Example 5
:::

::: ex-cont
$A, B,$ and $C$ toss a fair coin in order. The first to throw heads wins. What are their respective chances of winning?
:::
:::

**Solution:** Let

-   $A_H$ and $A_T$ be the events player A tosses heads and tails, respectively.

-   Similarly define $B_H$, $B_T$, $C_H$, and $C_T$.
