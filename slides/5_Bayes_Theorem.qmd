## Introduction

-   So we learned about conditional probabilities

    -   We learned how the occurrence of event A affects event B (B conditional on A)

-   Can we figure out information on how the occurrence of event B affects event A?

-   We can use the conditional probability ($\mathbb{P}(A|B)$) to get information on the flipped conditional probability ($\mathbb{P}(B|A)$)

Theorem: Bayes' Rule (for two events)
:::

::: thm-cont
For any two events $A$ and $B$ with nonzero probabilties,

$$\mathbb{P}(A| B) = 
\frac{\mathbb{P}(A) \cdot \mathbb{P}(B|A)}
{\mathbb{P}(B)}$$

Suppose we draw 5 cards from a standard shuffled deck of 52 cards. What is the probability of a flush, that is all the cards are of the same suit (including straight flushes)?

Higher Order Multiplication Rule

::: fact-cont
$$\mathbb{P}(A_1\cap A_2 \cap  \ldots \cap A_n)=\mathbb{P}(A_1)\cdot\mathbb{P}(A_2|A_1)\cdot\mathbb{P}(A_3|A_1A_2)\ldots \cdot\mathbb{P}(A_n|A_1A_2\ldots A_{n-1})$$

Law of Total Probability for 2 Events
:::

::: fact-cont
For events $A$ and $B$,

$$%\left(
\begin{array}{ccl}
\mathbb{P}(B)&=&\mathbb{P}(B \cap A) + \mathbb{P}(B \cap A^C)\\
           &=& \mathbb{P}(B|A) \cdot \mathbb{P}(A)+ \mathbb{P}(B | A^C)\cdot \mathbb{P}(A^C)
\end{array}
%\right)$$

Example 5.3
:::

::: ex-cont
Individuals are diagnosed with a particular type of cancer that can take on three different disease forms,\* $D_1$, $D_2$, and $D_3$. It is known that amongst people diagnosed with this particular type of cancer,

-   20% of people will eventually be diagnosed with form $D_1$,

-   30% with form $D_2$, and

-   50% with form $D_3$.

The probability of requiring chemotherapy ($C$) differs among the three forms of disease:

-   80% with $D_1$,

-   30% with $D_2$, and

-   10% with $D_3$.

Based solely on the preliminary test of being diagnosed with the cancer, what is the probability of requiring chemotherapy (the event C)?

Law of Total Probability (general)
:::

::: fact-cont
If $\{A_i\}_{i=1}^{n} = \{A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n\}$ form a partition of the sample space, then for event $B$,

$$%\left(
\begin{array}{ccl}
\mathbb{P}(B)&=& \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{P}(B \cap A_i)\\
           &=& \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{P}(B|A_i) \cdot \mathbb{P}(A_i)
\end{array}
%\right)$$

Example 5.4
:::

::: ex-cont
Recall the color-blind example (Example [2](#Ex_colorblind){reference-type="ref" reference="Ex_colorblind"}), where

-   a person is male with probability 0.5,

-   males are color-blind with probability 0.05, and

-   all people are color-blind with probability 0.03.

Find the probability that a color-blind person is male.

Example 5.5

Suppose

-   1% of women aged 40-50 years have breast cancer,

-   a woman with breast cancer has a 90% chance of a positive test from a mammogram, and

-   a woman has a 10% chance of a false-positive result from a mammogram.

What is the probability that a woman has breast cancer given that she just had a positive test?

Theorem: Bayes' Rule
:::

::: thm-cont
If $\{A_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$ form a partition of the sample space $S$, with $\mathbb{P}(A_i)>0$ for $i=1\ldots n$ and $\mathbb{P}(B)>0$, then

$$\mathbb{P}(A_j | B) = 
\frac{\mathbb{P}(B|A_j) \cdot \mathbb{P}(A_j)}
{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{P}(B|A_i) \cdot \mathbb{P}(A_i)}$$
