**Scenario:** There are repeated independent trials, each resulting in a
success or failure, with constant probability of success for each trial.
We are counting the number of trials until the first success.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: example
**Example 1**. *Â  We throw darts at a dartboard until we hit the
bullseye. Assume throws are independent and the probability of hitting
the bullseye is 0.01 for each throw.*

1.  *What is the pmf for the number of throws until we hit the
    bullseye?*

    ***Solution:***

2.  *What are the mean and variance for the number of throws until we
    hit the bullseye?*

    ***Solution:***

3.  *Find the probability that our first bullseye:*

    1.  *is on the fourth try*

        ***Solution:***

    2.  *is on one of the first four tries*

        ***Solution:***

    3.  *is after the fifth try*

        ***Solution:***

    4.  *is on one of the first fifty tries*

        ***Solution:***

    5.  *is after the $50^{th}$ try, given that it did not happen on the
        first 20 tries.*

        ***Solution:***

4.  *Find the expected number of misses until we hit the bullseye.*

    ***Solution:***
