**Scenario:** There are repeated independent trials, each resulting in a
success or failure, with constant probability of success for each trial.
We are counting the number of trials until the $r^{th}$ success.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: example
**Example 1**. *Â  Consider again the bullseye example, where we throw
darts at a dartboard until we hit the bullseye. Assume throws are
independent and the probability of hitting the bullseye is 0.01 for each
throw.*

1.  *What is the probability that the $5^{th}$ bullseye is on the
    $20^{th}$ throw?*

    ***Solution:***
