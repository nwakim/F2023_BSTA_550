Course Materials on Sakai for more practice.

\* For #3.13, mathematically solve for the sample size instead of
plugging in numbers and guessing.

Non-textbook problems (NTB): []{#NTB label="NTB"}

1.  []{#Ch_3_pens label="Ch_3_pens"} Deep in the depths of a student's
    backpack is a collection of pens in different colors. There are 5
    black, 4 blue, 3 green, and 2 purple pens.

    1.  If the student randomly selects 8 pens from the backpack
        [without]{.underline} replacement, what is the probability that
        they took 2 black, 3 blue, 2 green, and 1 purple pens?

    2.  If the student randomly selects 8 pens from the backpack
        [with]{.underline} replacement (returning the selected pen after
        each draw), what is the probability that they took a purple pen
        3 times?

    3.  If the student randomly selects pens from the backpack
        [with]{.underline} replacement (returning the selected pen after
        each draw) until they get the $3^{rd}$ green pen, what is the
        probability that they get the $3^{rd}$ green pen on the
        $10^{th}$ draw?

2.  []{#Ch3_mutindep label="Ch3_mutindep"} Recall from class, that we
    defined events $A,B,$ and $C$ to mutually independent if both (1)
    and (2) below hold. This point of this exercise is to show that
    $(1)\nRightarrow (2),$ and $(2)\nRightarrow (1).$
    $$\begin{array}{cc}
    (1) & \mathbb{P}(A\cap B\cap C)=\mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P(}B)\mathbb{P(}C) \\ 
    (2) & \mathbb{P}(A\cap B)=\mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P(}B) \\ 
    & \mathbb{P}(A\cap C)=\mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P(}C) \\ 
    & \mathbb{P}(B\cap C)=\mathbb{P}(B)\mathbb{P(}C)%
    \end{array}%$$

    1.  []{label=""} Suppose two different fair dice are rolled. Let
        events $A,B,$ and $C$ be defined in the following way:
        $$\begin{array}{cl}
        A: & \text{Roll a total of 7} \\ 
        B: & \text{First die is a 6} \\ 
        C: & \text{Second die is a 2}%
        \end{array}%$$

        Show that condition $(2)\ $holds, but that condition (1) does
        not.

    2.  Suppose two different fair dice are rolled. Let events $A,B,$
        and $C$ be defined in the following way: $$\begin{array}{cl}
        A: & \text{Roll a 1 or 2 on the first die} \\ 
        B: & \text{Roll a 3, 4, or 5 on the second die} \\ 
        C: & \text{Roll a total of 4, 11, or 12}%
        \end{array}%$$

        Show that condition $(1)\ $holds, but that condition (2) does
        not.

3.  []{#Ch5_Bayes_F16Ex1 label="Ch5_Bayes_F16Ex1"} A new drug is
    packaged to contain 30 pills in a bottle. Suppose that 98% of all
    bottles contain no defective pills, 1.5% contain one defective pill,
    and 0.5% contain two defective pills. Two pills from a bottle are
    randomly selected and tested. What is the probability that there are
    2 defective pills in the bottle given that one of the two tested
    pills is defective?

4.  []{#Ch5_Bayes_F05Ex1_solve_for_n
    label="Ch5_Bayes_F05Ex1_solve_for_n"} Suppose you are taking a
    multiple choice exam with 20 questions, where each question has five
    choices for an answer. Some of the questions you know the answer to
    and the others you guess by choosing one of the five choices
    randomly. Suppose that the probability of your knowing the correct
    answer to a randomly selected question given that you got it right
    is 0.88. How many of the 20 questions were you prepared for?
