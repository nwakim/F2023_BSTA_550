\* In addition to the graphs, include piecewise defined functions for
the pmf and cdf.

\*\* Break up your solution to Chapter 9 #8 into the following 5 parts:

1.  Make a table of the joint probabilities for $X$ and $Y$.

2.  Using the table in the previous part, write down the
    piecewise-defined equation for $p_{X,Y}(x,y)$. There should be only
    3 pieces (cases) for $p_{X,Y}(x,y)$.

3.  Express $p_Y(y)$ as a formula (i.e. a function in terms of $y$).

4.  Find the conditional pmf $p_{X|Y}(x|y)$ and express your answer as a
    piecewise-defined equation. There should be only 3 pieces (cases)
    for $p_{X|Y}(x|y)$.

5.  Make a table of the joint cdf $F_{X,Y}(x,y)$ values.

1.  []{#Ch9_Smoking_vs_Education label="Ch9_Smoking_vs_Education"} The
    following table shows the results of a survey in which the subjects
    were a sample of 300 adults residing in a certain metropolitan area.
    Each subject was asked to indicate which of three policies they
    favored with respect to smoking in public places. (Table is from
    *Biostatistics: A Foundation for Analysis in the Health Sciences*,
    10th Edition, Daniel, Wayne W.; Cross, Chad L., pg. 630)

    Let $X=$ highest education level and $Y=$ policy favored. We can let
    $X=1$ for college graduate, $X=2$ for high-school graduate, etc.,
    and similarly for $Y$, or just keep the category names for the
    different levels of $X$ and $Y$

    1.  Make a table for the joint pmf $p_{X,Y}(x,y)$ and briefly
        describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    2.  Find the marginal pmf $p_{X}(x)$ and briefly describe in words
        what the values are the probability of.

    3.  Find the marginal pmf $p_{Y}(y)$ and briefly describe in words
        what the values are the probability of.

    4.  Make a table for the joint cdf $F_{X,Y}(x,y)$ and briefly
        describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    5.  Find the marginal cdf $F_{X}(x)$ and briefly describe in words
        what the values are the probability of.

    6.  Find the marginal cdf $F_{Y}(y)$ and briefly describe in words
        what the values are the probability of.

    7.  Make a table for the conditional pmf $p_{X|Y}(x|y)$ and briefly
        describe in words what the values are the probability of.

    8.  Make a table for the conditional pmf $p_{Y|X}(y|x)$ and briefly
        describe in words what the values are the probability of.

2.  []{#Ch9_Nmbr2_extended label="Ch9_Nmbr2_extended"} **Forgetful
    mornings revisited**. Using the joint pmf you found in Chapter 9 #2,
    complete the following questions:

    1.  Find the joint cdf of $X$ and $Y$ and briefly explain what
        $F_{X,Y}(x,y)$ represents in the context of the problem.

    2.  Find the conditional pmf $p_{Y|X}(y|x)$.

    -     $X\in(0,\infty)$, continuous; $Y\in\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$, discrete

    -     $X_j\in[0,\infty),j=1,\ldots,100$; $Y\in[0,\infty)$; both
        continuous

    -     $Y$ could be 0

    -     Yes, a r.v. can be both. Give an example!
