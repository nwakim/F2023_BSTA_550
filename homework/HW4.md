in the "Turn In\" column. Please submit problems in the order they are
listed.

*You must show all of your work to receive credit. Don't forget to
define every r.v. you use!* *In particular, **if a similar problem was
done in class or an example in the book, make sure to still show every

\* Use Chapter 10 techniques when computing expected values for Chapter
10 problems, i.e. computing the expected value directly using the
definition of $\mathbb{E}[X]$.

\*\* Use Chapter 11 techniques when computing expected values for
Chapter 11 problems, i.e. expressing the r.v. as a sum of other r.v.'s
and calculating the expected value of the sum of r.v.'s. Also, as I
mentioned in class and posted on Sakai, we will be skipping the more
complex examples of finding expected values using indicator r.v.'s. You
can skip Examples 11.5, 11.10, and 11.11. We will not be covering these
techniques.

\*\*\* Although Chapter 11 exercises, these are to be done using Chapter
10 techniques since we aren't covering the more complex examples of
finding expected values using indicator r.v.'s.

Non-textbook problems (NTB): []{#NTB label="NTB"}

1.  []{#Ch10_Ch9_Nmbr2_expected_value
    label="Ch10_Ch9_Nmbr2_expected_value"} **Forgetful mornings
    revisited again**. Recall from Chapter 9 #2, that $X$ is the number
    of days until Maude loses her cell phone and each day she has a 1%
    chance of losing her phone (her behavior on different days being
    independent). For this problem, ignore the r.v. $Y$, and consider
    the r.v. $X$ on its own.

    1.  What is the pmf of $X$?

    2.  Use the pmf of $X$ to find $\mathbb{E}[X]$.

2.  []{#Ch11_E_Binomial_Female_Vets label="Ch11_E_Binomial_Female_Vets"}
    Approximately 10% of U.S. Veterans are women. Suppose an
    investigator plans a study with 4500 participants that are Veterans.
    How many women can they expect to be included? *Your answer must be
    calculated by defining a random variable and showing how to
    calculate the expected value.*

3.  []{#Ch11_Ch10_Nmbr8_expected_value_Hypergeo
    label="Ch11_Ch10_Nmbr8_expected_value_Hypergeo"} **Cashews
    revisited**. Recall from Chapter 10 #8, that a bowl contains 30
    cashews, 20 pecans, 25 almonds, and 25 walnuts, and 3 nuts are
    randomly selected to eat (without replacement). Again, find the
    expected value of the number of cashews, but this time by defining
    the number of cashews as a sum of random variables.
