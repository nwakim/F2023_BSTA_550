%* Please note the following for Chapter 22:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item See the table on pg. 277, which summarizes some key combinatorics concepts.
%%\item I placed a discrete math book (\emph{Discrete Mathematics}, Epp), on reserve for MTH 461 in the library. If you're struggling with this topic, I encourage you to check it out.
%\item Problems 39-48 are a set that build on one another and more advanced than the other problems.  It'll be much easier to do \#42 after doing 39-41.
%\item I \emph{highly} recommend reading Chapter 23, which is a series of case studies in counting: poker hands and Yahtzee.

% Chapter 22 - choir
%-----------------------------------

%% From F17 Exam 1; on F18 hw
%\item \label{NTB_22_choir} The director of a choral group decided that at every rehearsal the choir would sit in a different configuration. There are four sections in the choir: basses (B), tenors (T), altos (A), and sopranos (S). Assume that basses and tenors are all men and altos and sopranos are all women.
%The seating at rehearsal has the director in the middle with 2 rows of singers on both sides of him facing towards the center. The diagram below is an example with 4 singers in each of the sections.
%
%\smallskip
%
%B\  \  T\  \   director\  \   A\  \   S  \newline
%B\  \   T\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  A\  \   S \newline
%B\  \   T\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  A\  \   S \newline
%B\  \   T\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  A\  \   S \newline
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%
%\item Assuming there is assigned seating within each section, how many ways are there to arrange the sections for rehearsal?
%
%\item A problem that arose with this seating plan was that one couldn't hear the women singing if men were sitting in front of them, and it was decided that no seating plans with women sitting behind men would be allowed. For example, the following arrangement would not be allowed: \newline
%
%A  \  T\  \   director\  \   B\  \   S  \newline
%A\  \   T\  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  \  B\  \   S \newline
%...
%
%
%With this restriction, how many ways are there to arrange the sections for rehearsal (assuming there is assigned seating within each section)?
%
%\textbf{For the remaining parts, assume men can sit in front of women (as in part (a))}
%
%\item The choir consists of 10 basses, 9 tenors, 11 altos, and 12 sopranos. How many seating arrangements are possible if singers have to sit together within their respective sections but do not have assigned seating?
%
%\item To complicate matters, there are actually two parts within each section. There are 5 B1's, 5 B2's, 4 T1's, 5 T2's, 5 A1's, 6 A2's, 6 S1's, and 6 S2's. How many ways are there to arrange the singers if they are sitting not only within their sections, but the singers on the $1^{st}$ part are all together and the singers on the $2^{nd}$ part are all together?
%
%\item How many ways are there to arrange the singers if they are sitting within their sections, but members of the same part cannot sit next to each other? For example, a B1 cannot sit next to a B1 and a B2 cannot sit next to a B2. Use the numbers on each part given in (d).

%\emph{Practice with the $\mathtt{sample}$ function}
%
%Recall that the $\mathtt{sample}$ function in R takes a sample of specified size from the elements given in its first argument.
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Look up the help file for the $\mathtt{sample}$ function. Explain what the argument \emph{replace} does in the $\mathtt{sample}$ function.
%\item Use the $\mathtt{sample}$ function to simulate ten rolls of a six-sided (fair) die. Apply the $\mathtt{table}$ command to get a quick summary of your results.
%\item Suppose you have a population of 1000 people, where 500 are Democrat, 300 are Republican, and 200 are Independent. 
%	\begin{enumerate}
%	\item How many Democrats would you expect to get in a simple random sample of 10 people from this population? \emph{Calculate this exactly using arithmetic, meaning do not simulate it.}
%	\item Use the $\mathtt{sample}$ function to simulate taking a simple random sample of 10 people from this population, where you only record the person's political preference ("D", "R", or "I"). How many Democrats did you get in your sample? How does this compare to your answer in part i.? 
%	\newline \emph{Hint: First you need to create a dataset consisting of D's, R's, and I's to sample from. The $\mathtt{rep}$ command might be useful for this.}
%	\item Repeat the previous step 100 times and save the number of Democrats in each sample. 
%		\begin{enumerate}
%		\item What is the mean number of Democrats from these 100 simulations? Is your answer surprising? Why or why not?
%		\item Make a histogram of the 100 results, and describe the distribution shape. What are the min and max number of Democrats selected from the 100 simulations?

%
%\emph{Simulating the probability of $r$ heads in $n$ coin tosses} \newline
%\begin{itemize}
%\item For these coin problems, assume that a fair coin is being used.
%\item To be able to discuss your simulation results without worrying that they change each time you compile your file, I recommend first setting a seed in R: $\mathtt{set.seed()}$.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Using 10,000 trials (simulations), simulate the following probabilities  
%	\begin{enumerate}
%     \item Probability of three heads in three coin tosses.
%     \item Probability of 61 heads in 100 coin tosses.
%     \item Create an R function that will simulate the probability of $r$ heads in $n$ coin tosses with $m$ simulations, where $r$, $n$, and $m$ are parameters the user can choose.
%     \item Compare the answers your function creates with those of parts 1 and 2. Are they similar?
%     \item  Compare your answers of parts 1 and 2 to the actual probabilities found by. Are they similar?
%	\end{enumerate}
%\end{enumerate}
%
%\item Still using 10,000 trials and a fair coin, simulate 100 coin tosses and keep track of the number of heads on each trial.
%	\begin{enumerate}
%	\item Make a histogram of the number of heads in 100 tosses from each of the simulations. Describe the shape of the distribution, center and spread (what are the min and max? ``most" values are typically between ... and ...).
%	\item Compute the mean and standard deviation for the number of heads from the simulations.
%	\item What percent of values (number of heads) were within one standard deviation of the mean? Two sd? Three sd? Do these percentages look familiar to you? If so, from where?

Assume that before any conditioning (in trial number 1) rats are equally likely to go the left or to the right. After having received food on a particular trial, the probability of going to the left and right become 0.6 and 0.4, respectively on the following trial. However, after receiving a shock on a particular trial, the probabilities of going to the left and right on the next trial are 0.8 and 0.2, respectively. What is the probability that the animal will turn left on trial number 2?

%\item \label{Ch5_politics}In an upstate congressional race, the incumbent Republican ($R$) is running against a field of three Democrats ($D_1,D_2,D_3$) seeking the nomination. Political pundits estimate that the probabilities of $D_1,D_2,$ and $D_3$ winning the primary are 0.35, 0.40, and 0.25, respectively. Furthermore, results from a variety of polls are suggesting that $R$ would have a 40\% chance of defeating $D_1$ in the general election, a 35\% chance of defeating $D_2$, and a 60\% chance of defeating $D_3$. Assuming all these estimates to be accurate, what are the chances that the Republican will retain his seat?

%\item \label{Ch5_Enterprise}The crew of the Starship \textit{Enterprise} is considering launching a surprise attack against the Borg in a neutral quadrant. Possible interference by the Klingons, though, is causing Captain Picard and Data to reassess their strategy. According to Data's calculations, the probability of the Klingons joining forces with the Borg is 0.2384. Captain Picard feels that the probability of the attack being successful is 0.8 if the \textit{Enterprise} can catch the Borg alone, but only 0.3 if they have to engage both adversaries. Data claims that the mission would be a tactical misadventure if its probability of success were not at least 0.7306. Should the \textit{Enterprise} attack?

%\emph{Answer: Attacking would be a tactical misadventure (0.6808).}

%\item \label{Ch5_Basil} Brett and Margo have each though about murdering their rich Uncle Basil in hopes of claiming their inheritance a bit early. Hoping to take advantage of Basil's predilection for immoderate desserts, Brett has put rat poison in the cherries flambe; Margo, unaware of Brett's activities, has laced the chocolate mousse with cyanide. Given the amounts likely to be eaten, the probability of the rat poison being fatal is 0.60; the cyanide, 0.90. Based on other dinners where Basil was presented with the same dessert options, we can assume that he has a 50\% chance of asking for the cherries flambe, a 40\% chance of ordering the chocolate mousse, and a 10\% chance of skipping dessert altogether. No sooner are the dishes cleared away when Basil drops dead. In the absence of any other evidence, who should be considered the prime suspect?

%\emph{Answer: Margo should be considered the prime suspect (0.55).}

%\item \label{Ch5_Bayes_F05Ex1_solve_for_n} Suppose you are taking a multiple choice exam with 20 questions, where each question has five choices for an answer. Some of the questions you know the answer to and the others you guess by choosing one of the five choices randomly. Suppose that the probability of your knowing the correct answer to a randomly selected question given that you got it right is 0.88. How many of the 20 questions were you prepared for?

%%\noindent\underline{\textsc{Solution}}:\newline
%%Let $C$ be the event you got a randomly selected questions  correct. Let $P$
