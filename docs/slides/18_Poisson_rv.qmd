## Learning Objectives

1.  Identify the variable and the parameters of a Poisson distribution in a word problem, and state what
    the variable and parameters mean.
2.  Use the formulas for the pmf/CDF, expected value, and variance to
    answer questions and find probabilities.

## Properties of Poisson RVs

-   **Scenario:** We are counting the number of successes in a fixed
    time period, which has a constant rate of successes
-   Shorthand: $X \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)$ or $X \sim \text{Pois}(\lambda)$

$$
X = \text{Number of successes in a given period}
$$

$$ p_X(x) = P(X=x) = \dfrac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^x}{x!} \text{ for } x = 0, 1, 2,3, ...$$

$$ E(X) = \lambda$$

$$Var(X) = \lambda$$

## Distingushing between Binomial and Poisson RVs

-   Recall that if $X\sim Binomial(n,p)$, then

    -   $X$ models the number of successes ...

    -   in $n$ independent (Bernoulli) trials ...

    -   that each have the same probability of success $p$.

-   Poisson r.v.'s are similar,

    -   except that instead of having $n$ discrete independent trials,

    -   there is a **fixed time period** during which the successes happen.

## Examples of Poisson RVs

-   Number of visitors to an emergency room in an hour during a weekend
    night

-   Number of study participants enrolled in a study per week

-   Number of pedestrians walking through a square mile

-   Any more?

## Emergency Room Visitors

::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
::: example
::: ex-title
Example 1
:::
::: ex-cont
Suppose an emergency room has an average of 50 visitors
per day. Find the following probabilities.

1.  Probability of 30 visitors in a day.

2.  Probability of 8 visitors in an hour.

3.  Probability of at least 8 visitors in an hour.

## Combining independent Poisson distributions

::: theorem
::: thm-title
Theorem 1
:::
::: thm-cont
If $X\sim Poiss(\lambda_1)$ and
$Y\sim Poiss(\lambda_2)$ are independent of each other, then
$Z=X+Y\sim Poiss(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2)$.

## Two emergency rooms

::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
::: example
::: ex-title
Example 2
:::
::: ex-cont
Suppose emergency room 1 has an average of 50 visitors
per day, and emergency room 2 has an average of 70 visitors per day,
independently of each other. What is the probability distribution to
model of the total number of visitors to both?

## Poisson Approximation of the Binomial

Both Poisson and Binomial r.v.'s are counting the number of successes

-   If for a Binomial r.v.

    -   the number of trials $n$ is very large, and

    -   the probability of success $p$ is close to 0 or 1,

-   then the Poisson distribution can be used to approximate Binomial
    probabilities
    
    -   and we use $\lambda = np$

## Medical lab errors

::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
::: example
::: ex-title
Example 3
:::
::: ex-cont
Suppose that in the long run, errors in a medical
testing lab are made 0.1% of the time. Find the probability that fewer
than 4 mistakes are made in the next 2,000 tests.

1.  Find the probability using the Binomial distribution.

2.  Approximate the probability in part (1) using the Poisson distribution.
