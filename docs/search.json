    "text": "Online Resources\n\nSlack\nWe will use Slack as our main form of communication for the class. I will try to mirror the Slack Workspace that you had for 512/612.¬†If you are unsure how to do a homework problem or have other questions, please ask myself or the TA‚Äôs either by email or posting your question(s) on Slack. Please know that Slack is not guarded by the OSHU firewall, so if you have a question about accommodations or any sensitive topics, you may wish to message me via email. You can still message me regarding sensitive information on Slack, but I will not initiate those conversations on Slack. Please continue to use the tips on asking for help that Meike laid out in the 512/612 syllabus. I will also add her tips to the Slack workspace.\n**Please use this invitation link for our Slack workspace!**\n\n\nSakai\nCourse materials will be delivered online through Sakai, OHSU‚Äôs course management system. This is where you‚Äôll find all course materials (syllabus, videos, lectures, homework assignments, announcements, etc.). This is also where you‚Äôll submit all course assignments.\nI will try to keep the structure of the Sakai page similar to that of BSTA 512/612. It‚Äôs always tough for you, the students, to spend two quarters with one faculty member then change to a new one. That is why I will try my best to keep the Sakai navigation similar. However, certain aspects will certainly be different. I hope we can work together to identify the things that are and are not working for our classroom.¬†\n\n\nExplain Everything\nI plan to use Explain Everything on my iPad to deliver lectures. This application allows me to take real time notes, access Poll Everywhere, and record the lecture. I hope to use these features to allow you to follow me during lecture and have access to a recording for asynchronous viewing. While I will try to always make a recorded lecture available to you after class, I want you to try to attend class in person. I understand that life events get in the way on in-person attendance, but your attendance in-person brings me joy while I teach, and then further motivates me to be a great teacher.¬†\nNote: I am new to this application so I ask you for some grace as I learn to navigate it.¬†\n\n\nWebex\nWebex software will be used for office hours. To give everyone the best possible experience with Webex, we recommend the following best practices:\n\nPlease stay muted until you want to participate\nDuring office hours, please send a message in chat with your question or with a statement like ‚ÄúI have a question.‚Äù This makes sure I or the TA can address everyone‚Äôs questions in order.¬†\nI encourage you to attend office hours with your video on. This helps me recognize you, and keep mental notes on what techniques/concepts I emphasize to facilitate your specific understanding.¬†\n\n\n\nPoll Everywhere\nWe will use the Poll Everywhere tool as an interactive feature of the course. Poll Everywhere is a web-based application that allows students to participate by responding via text messages or by visiting a web page on an internet-enabled device (smartphone, tablet, laptop). Instructions will be displayed on-screen. The poll that is embedded within the presentation will update in real time. While there is no cost to use this software, standard text messaging rates will apply if you use your phone. Please make sure that you have a Poll Everywhere account before our first class. You are not required to use your OHSU/PSU email to make an account.¬†\nDuring lectures I will pose questions to the class. These questions are designed to provide real-time feedback to both students and the instructor on how well students are grasping the material. This is meant to be an interactive, learning activity with NO contribution to your grade. Your identity will never be connected to your answers, so I encourage you to answer honestly.\n\n\nPennState STAT 414 Website\nPennState has a class offered to advanced undergraduates that has some overlap with our class. They have all their course notes posted on thispage. This is a great source if you would like to see class notes with different phrasing.\nNot all of our topics are covered in their notes, but the most important ones are. If you are having trouble finding our course‚Äôs concepts on their page, please make ask me at Office Hours, after class, or in a private meeting. I do not explicitly state corresponding sections under our schedule because I believe it is important for you to develop skills involving resources and learning key words that can help you find answers.¬†\n\n\nR: Statistical Computing Software\nStudents will use statistical software to complete homework assignments. Students are required to use R/RStudio for this course. R can be freely downloaded. Helpful documentation on installing R is available. I encourage you to install R prior to attending our first lecture. Please email me if you need help installing R or RStudio.\nYou will need to download the following three things:\n\nR https://www.r-project.org/\nRstudio https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nQuarto https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/\n\n\nAdditional R Resources\nYour learning and practicing of R will hopefully not be limited to this course. One of the best aspects of programming in R is that many resources are freely available online. Here are just a few additional resources you may explore beyond this class to continue your training in R.\n\n\nUseful online R resources\n\nR for the rest of us\nStatistical tools for high-throughput data analysis. ggplot2 essentials\nR-bloggers\nStack Overflow for troubleshooting\nR Graphical Manual\nQuick-R.

    "text": "Types of assessments\nThis class will use a combination of formative and summative assessments to build and test our knowledge. Below I define each of these types of assessments:\n\nFormative assessment: Activity or work meant to help students learn and practice. Grading of these assessments are meant to help the instructor and student identify gaps in knowledge and highlight accomplishments.\nSummative assessment: Work meant to test how well students have achieved learning objectives. Grading of these assessments are meant to gauge how well a student grasps the learning objectives and will be able to use their knowledge outside of the classroom.\n\nStudents will always have the opportunity to redo formative assessments until they are satisfied with their grade. That means students can redo homework and readings until they are satisfied with their grade. This is meant to emphasize the learning process, and reduce pressure for correctness. However, there are some limitations on ‚Äúredoing‚Äù your work. In the homework grading scale (shown in Criteria), you might notice that certain grades correspond to a certain percentage of the homework completed. You can only redo problems that you have completely worked through. Thus, you can only increase your grade by increasing the amount of correct problems."

This class may not be a priority to you, you may be taking several other courses, or you may need to dedicate time to other activities. Homeworks are formative assessments, meaning its purpose is to help you learn and practice. To reduce the pressure on you to have perfect or complete homework, I have a very simple grading policy: Your homework will be given a check mark if you turn something in (whether it is incomplete, complete, correct, or wrong). I highly encourage you to stay up-to-date with the homeworks and put in as much effort as you can. This will be the most helpful work in this class!\nAfter the due date, either the TA or myself will post the solutions.\n\n\nViewing Grades in Sakai\nPoints you receive for graded activities will be posted to the Sakai Gradebook. Click on the Gradebook link on the left navigation to view your points.\n\n\nLate Work Policy\nI encourage you to make your best effort to submit all assignments on time, but I understand circumstances arise that are beyond our control. Please see this Swansea University‚Äôs page on extenuating circumstances for some examples. Not all circumstances are covered here, so please reach out if you have questions.¬†\n\nEach of you will receive one ‚Äúno questions asked‚Äù extension on any homework assignment. To request the extension, you can write an email with subject ‚ÄúExtension on Homework Assignment __‚Äù with body saying ‚ÄúI would like an extension on Homework Assignment __ for __ days.‚Äù I will grant you that extension with no questions asked.\n\nIf you have already used a ‚Äúno questions asked‚Äù extension on homework, then homework grades will go down one point for every day it is late. For example, if your work is on par of a 5/5, but you turn it in homework 2 days late, then you will receive a 3/5.¬†\n\nThe class will end on June 16, 2023. All coursework is expected to be completed by then. If you have extenuating circumstances, and need additional time to complete class assignments, please contact me. Together, we will come up with a plan for completion and to sort out registrar logistics.\nIf you have extenuating circumstances that may jeopardize your ability to do work for several weeks, please contact me. We will come up with a plan to keep you on track in the course and prevent any delay in your education.\nFor non-homework assignments, I ask you to email me directly. You can explain your circumstances and may ask me for an extension, but I won‚Äôt necessarily grant one.\nIf you have a emergency involving your self, family, pet, friend, classmate, or anything/one deemed important to you, please do not worry about immediately contacting me. We can work something out after your emergency. If I contact you during an emergency, it is only because I am worried, and you do NOT need to respond until you are able.¬†\n\n\n\nRegrade Policy\nIf you think a question was incorrectly graded, first compare your answer to the answer key. If you believe a re-grade would be appropriate, write an email to me containing the question and a short explanation as to why the question(s) was/were incorrectly graded. Deadline: One week after assignments were returned to class (late requests will not be considered).\n\n\nAttendance Policy\nYou are expected to attend class and participate in class polls and the exit ticket. For students who miss class or need a review, I will make video and audio recordings of lectures available. There are no guarantees against technical or other challenges for the recording availability or quality. For students who are unable to attend the class in-person and synchronously, viewing the recording within 7 days is acceptable. Make sure to complete the exit ticket to demonstrate attendance."

    "section": "1.1 Introduction",
    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nThe introduction in this chapter starts with the following quote:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúProbability theory is the study of randomness and all things associated with randomness.‚Äù\n\n\n\nI couldn‚Äôt say it better myself. There are examples with obvious hints at randomness (i.e.¬†dice rolls, coins flips) and there are examples with not-so-obvious randomness involved (i.e.¬†time until any given traffic light turns green).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 1.1\n\n\n\nWhen something happens at random there are several potential outcomes. Exactly one of the outcomes occurs. An event is defined to be a collection of some outcomes.\n\n\nOur goal in probability and statistics is to characterize randomness. Then as statisticians, we can use what we know about randomness to see if certain features of the world is within randomness or outside the randomness. For example, according to a New York Times article published on July 25, 2023, the Education Department is investigating Harvard University‚Äôs legacy admissions policy. Here is an excerpt from that article:\n\nHarvard gives preference to applicants who are recruited athletes, legacies, relatives of donors and children of faculty and staff. As a group, they make up less than 5 percent of applicants, but around 30 percent of those admitted each year. About 67.8 percent of these applicants are white, according to court papers.\n\nUsing probability, we can start to see why this practice might be inequitable. If these applicants make up 5% of the total applicant pool, and we completely, randomly chose applicants to admit, then we would expect 5% of admitted students to be this group of recruited athletes, legacies, relatives of donors, and children of faculty and staff. We could argue that recruited athletes are more likely to be admitted since they are, in fact, recruited, or that children of faculty and staff might ‚Äúgame‚Äù high school succesfully because they live in a home that subscribes to the academic world. If we want to compare the acceptance rate of 30% for this group to the average acceptance rate, the article actually fails to present a crucial peice of information: the average acceptance rate. I looked it up, and it is ~4%. So now we can start to think about questions like: With an average acceptance rate of 4%, does an acceptance of 30% of this group of recruited athletes, legacies, relatives of donors and children of faculty and staff make sense? We will explore this example further as we progress through our class.\nBaaack to our definitions: When we have several potential outcomes, and an event is a collection of outcomes, then we can start thinking of the set of potential outcomes. When there are no outcomes, then we have the empty set \\(\\emptyset\\). When we look at all outcomes, we call it the sample space \\(S\\). For now, when we look at a single event, we will focus on the sample space. When we start thinking of multiple events, the empty set might come into play. And just to reiterate: The empty set is an event. It is an impossible event, but it is still considered an event. So when you consider all possible events, the empty set is included. When you consider all possible outcomes, this is the sample space.\nNow let‚Äôs look at at an example with an obvious hint at randomness:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.2\n\n\n\nYou roll a 6-sided die.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.2 Explanation\n\n\n\n\n\nA 6-sided die has sides labelled 1-6. Thus, the sample space is \\(S=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\) since we can land on any of the 6 sides. For every roll, only one of these outcomes occur, and that outcome is random.\nAn event can be any subgroup (more formally, subset) of the sample space, but not necessarily. Events can technically be outside of the sample space, but we often only consider events within the sample space.\nIf we can say our event is if we roll a 6, then our event is defined mathematically as \\(\\{6\\}\\). We can define a different event as rolling an odd numbered side, then our event is defined mathematically as \\(\\{1,3,5\\}\\). See TB pg 4 for more event examples.\n\n\n\nWe introduced subset, but here‚Äôs the definition:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 1.3\n\n\n\nEvent A is a subset of event B, written \\(A \\subset B\\). if every outcome in A is also an outcome in B.\n\n\n\nLet‚Äôs work on defining different types of events within sample spaces:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.4\n\n\n\nA student buys a book and opens it to a random page. They note the number of typographical errors on the page. Let‚Äôs define the sample space and discuss one potential event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.4 Explanation\n\n\n\n\n\nSince there must be 0 or more errors, and errors are counted with whole numbers, the sample space will be the set of nonnegative integers: \\(S=\\mathbb{Z}^{&gt;=0}\\). More plainly, \\(S=\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...\\}\\).\nHere are a few possible events we can consider: (I invite you to think of others if you‚Äôd like)\n\nevent that a page contains 4 errors\nevent that a page contains at most 3 errors\nevent that a page contains more than 3 errors\nevent that a page contains an odd number of errors.\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 1.11\n\n\n\nThe union of events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), denoted by \\(A \\cup B\\), contains all outcomes that are in \\(A\\) or \\(B\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 1.12\n\n\n\nThe intersection of events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), denoted by \\(A \\cap B\\), contains all outcomes that are both in \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)."

    "text": "Notes\nThere are a few things I‚Äôd like to address from the book:\n\nThere is a set of examples, 1.5 and 1.6, that talk about the birth of a baby. While this example is helpful for considering potential sample spaces, there is an oversight on the biology of births. The examples refer to the event of the sex assigned at birth (SAB). There are two issues in this example. First, SAB is considered binary in this example (I will get back to this). Second, the binary SAB is written as ‚Äúboy‚Äù or ‚Äúgirl.‚Äù These labels have gender identity inherently attached to their meaning, and thus, the more accurate binary versions of these are ‚Äúmale‚Äù or ‚Äúfemale,‚Äù respectively (‚ÄúAssigned Sex at Birth,‚Äù n.d.). These are often denoted as ‚Äúassigned male at birth‚Äù (AMAB) or ‚Äúassigned female at birth‚Äù (AFAB). Going back the first issue, a binary representation of SAB does not cover all possible events. People can also be intersex, meaning their genitals, chromosomes, and/or reproductive organs are not exclusively AMAB or AFAB (‚ÄúIntersex: What Is Intersex, Gender Identity, Intersex Surgery,‚Äù n.d.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtension to Example 1.5 and 1.6\n\n\n\nYou can go back to these examples (TB pg. 5) and work through them with the more accurate representation of sex at birth. Please use the possible outcomes of AFAB, AMAB, or intersex."

What value do you expect to get on a roll? :::\nSolution:\nRemark: Expected vs.¬†actual outcomes\n\n\nDefinition 3 (Expected value). The expected value of a discrete r.v. \\(X\\) that takes on values \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n\\) is \\[\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_ip_X(x_i).\\]\n\nRemarks:\n\nThe definition holds if the r.v. \\(X\\) takes on countably infinitely many values \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots\\), as well: \\[\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} x_ip_X(x_i).\\]\nAnother way to define the expected value of a discrete r.v. is to do so at the \\(\\omega\\) level, where the \\(\\omega\\)‚Äôs are outcomes in the sample space:\n\nSuppose \\(\\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\ldots, \\omega_n\\) are the possible outcomes of a random phenomenon. If outcome \\(\\omega_i\\) causes the r.v. X to take on value \\(x_i\\) (meaning \\(X(\\omega_i)=x_i\\)), then \\[\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} x_i\\mathbb{P}(\\{\\omega_i\\}).\\]\n\n\n\nExample 4. Suppose \\[X = \\left\\{\n        \\begin{array}{ll}\n            1 & \\quad \\mathrm{with\\ probability}\\ p \\quad\\mathrm{(success)}\\\\\n            0 & \\quad \\mathrm{with\\ probability}\\ 1-p \\quad\\mathrm{(failure)}\n        \\end{array}\n    \\right.\\] Find the expected value of \\(X\\).\n\nSolution:\n\n\nExample 5. Suppose \\[X = \\left\\{\n        \\begin{array}{ll}\n            1 & \\quad \\mathrm{with\\ probability}\\ p \\\\\n            -1 & \\quad \\mathrm{with\\ probability}\\ 1-p\n        \\end{array}\n    \\right.\\] Find the expected value of \\(X\\).\n\nSolution:\n\nExample 6. Suppose I throw darts at a dartboard until I hit the bullseye, and that my probability of hitting the bullseye is \\(p\\). Suppose further that all of my throws are independent, and that the probability of a bullseye never changes, no matter how many times I throw a dart. How many times should I expect to have to throw the dart until I hit the bullseye?\n\nSolution:\n\nExample 7. A ghost is trick-or-treating. It comes to a house where it is known that there are 30 candies in the bag and only one is a watermelon Jolly Rancher, which is the ghost‚Äôs favorite. The ghost takes pieces of candy without replacement until it gets the watermelon Jolly Rancher. How many pieces of candy do we expect the ghost to take?\n\nSolution:\nRemark: Both examples are repeated random processes. They are fundamentally different though:\n\nThe bullseye example (6) is \"with replacement\" since the probability of success remains constant.\nThe ghost trick-or-treating example (7) is without replacement, and thus the probability of success changes with each trial."

Recall from Chapter 10 #8, that a bowl contains 30 cashews, 20 pecans, 25 almonds, and 25 walnuts, and 3 nuts are randomly selected to eat (without replacement). Again, find the expected value of the number of cashews, but this time by defining the number of cashews as a sum of random variables.\n\n\nSelected answers (or hints) not provided at the end the book:\n\nChapter 10 \n\n¬†¬†750.5\n¬†¬†0.9\n¬†¬†201\n¬†¬†(a) 1.875 ¬†¬†¬†¬†(b) 3.125 ¬†¬†¬†¬†\n\nChapter 11 \n\n¬†¬†1.6\n¬†¬†a) 48.5 ¬†¬†¬†¬†(b) 96 ¬†¬†¬†¬†\n¬†¬†\\(\\approx\\) 23.077"
